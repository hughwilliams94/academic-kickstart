Now that my lockdown exams are finally done (for now!), it is time for me to focus on my MSc project. I am going to build a voice assistant for scientists working in laboratories (think Alexa, but for the labs).

I will be building the solution using the [Mycroft AI](https://mycroft.ai) platform, which is an open-source voice assistant. Functionality is added to the voice assistant in the form of 'skills' that are developed in Python. I hope to give the assistant the ability to read out lab protocols, perform common calculations, set timers and alarms, transcribe voice notes and send messages between lab team members.

I will try to post some updates on here outlining my progress towards the goals (not much real content, in case Turnitin tries to flag me for plagiarism).
