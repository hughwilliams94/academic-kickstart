Finished updating my personal website to take advantage of the new features of the Academic theme for Hugo. I've implemented most of the homepage widgets that seemed relevant to my needs and also added a link to the [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.de/hmlwilliams) page that I just setup. If and when lockdown ends, hopefully I can add some more snaps to my photo journal. 

Until then though, I have plenty to be getting on with: project proposal writing, coursework finalizing and exam revising.
