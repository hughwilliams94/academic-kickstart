Computer Science MSc student and freelance subeditor working out of Brixton, London. I have particular interests in the open-source movement, decentralization of internet technologies and the crossover between synthetic biology and technology. Since graduating from Imperial College London, I have worked in scientific publishing in both content- and business-focussed roles. Iâ€™ve always been passionate about science, technology and research, so helping researchers from around the world to communicate their results is a very fulfilling experience.
